Psimulator is a process scheduling simulator, demonstrating a simplified version of how hardware resources are managed in a real-time environment. It was written as an assignment for a course on Operating Systems, and uses the First Come First Serve algorithm.

A build script (build.sh) is included for convenience.
	
The program runs on standard input. To provide an input file, use piping:
	./psimulator < input.txt

Input should always begin with a declaration of the number of processor cores to be simulated:
	NCORES <int>

New processes can be declared with the NEW command, along with the timestamp at which the process is created:
	NEW <int>

After a process is declared, the commands to be simulated can be entered. These commands include:
	CORE <int>
	INPUT <int>
	SSD <int>
In all cases, the integer value denotes the amount of time in milliseconds that resource is to be used.

Process commands are listed in order; in other words, each resource-using command corresponds to the last process that was declared.
